# Hackbot1.0

How many of us have faced the embarrassment when our mobile phone suddenly rings during the meeting because we forgot to keep it on silent mode?
Do you dim the brightness of your mobile phone every day before sleeping?
Do you switch on the mobile data and switch off your WIFI every day before you leave for work from home and do the reverse when back home?
Wouldn't it be amazing if your mobile phone reminds you about your daily routine of calling your mom when you missed it someday due to work overload? 
Aren't you bored of doing this and the other mundane tasks every day, here comes HackBot your saviour.

The existing mobile applications available in the market are not automatic, the settings have to be configured manually and they also lack adaptability. They rely on internet and GPS to complete most of the predefined tasks.

HackBot will take care of your countless everyday tasks. HackBot automates the mobile settings that the user does regularly without manual intervention and internet.
HackBot gets smarter and customized by cognitive learning and unlearning based on user interactions with the mobile phone.

It is a mobile application that runs as a background service to learn and unlearn the user activities on daily basis.
It takes logical decisions based on the probability of each event, which has been calculated from the data gathered by the application based on user's actions by the service.
Users are provided with adaptive and personalized settings by automatically learning their repetitive mobile phone settings.

Use Case:
I attend a meeting every Monday from 10 O'clock to 11 O'clock. During which I put my mobile phone on silent and switch off my mobile data. The application observes me doing this every 2 consecutive Mondays. From the 3rd Monday, it learns to set my mobile phone on silent mode and switches off my mobile data automatically. But after a month of long and treacherous meetings, the schedule changed to Thursday from 11 O'clock to 12 O'clock. HackBot observes this, and unlearns the previous task based on the notification response from me and learns the new settings. 

HackBot is designed to make your life easier by automating your tasks and increasing your productivity.
As the user moves from one place to other such as from home to office, or from work to a meeting, the user changes the settings. The application will acknowledge the changes and sets itself accordingly.
It learns and unlearns from user's daily activities and automatically triggers these without any manual intervention. Also if your routine changes, it acknowledges it and adjusts its actions. It can be used to remind the user of his habits if it is skipped.
